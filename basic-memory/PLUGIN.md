# Basic Memory Plugin for Claude Code

This plugin provides skills, commands, and hooks for working with [Basic Memory](https://basicmemory.io) - a local-first knowledge management system built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Prerequisites

You need the Basic Memory MCP server running. Install it via:

```bash
# Install basic-memory
pip install basic-memory

# Or with pipx
pipx install basic-memory
```

Then add it to your Claude Code MCP configuration.

## Installation

### Add the Marketplace

```
/plugin marketplace add basicmachines-co/basic-memory/claude-code-plugin
```

### Install the Plugin

```
/plugin install basic-memory@basicmachines
```

### Or via Repository Settings

Add to your `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
      "basicmachines": {
        "source": {
          "source": "github",
          "repo": "basicmachines-co/basic-memory",
          "path": "claude-code-plugin"
        }
      }
    },
    "installed": ["basic-memory@basicmachines"]
  }
}
```

## Slash Commands

User-invoked commands for explicit interaction with Basic Memory.

### `/remember [title] [folder]`

Capture insights, decisions, or learnings from the current conversation.

```
/remember "FastAPI Async Pattern"
/remember "Auth Decision" decisions
```

Creates a structured note with:
- Context from the conversation
- Observations with `[decision]`, `[insight]`, `[pattern]` categories
- Relations linking to related concepts

### `/continue [topic]`

Resume previous work by building context from Basic Memory.

```
/continue postgres migration
/continue SPEC-24
/continue
```

If no topic is provided, shows recent activity and asks what to dive into.

### `/context <memory://url> [depth] [timeframe]`

Build context from a specific memory:// URL.

```
/context memory://SPEC-24
/context memory://architecture/* 3 2weeks
```

### `/recent [timeframe] [project]`

Show recent activity in Basic Memory.

```
/recent
/recent 1week
/recent today specs
```

### `/organize [action] [project]`

Organize and maintain your knowledge graph.

```
/organize                    # Quick health check
/organize orphans            # Find unlinked notes
/organize duplicates         # Find similar notes
/organize relations "Note"   # Suggest links for a note
/organize tags               # Review tag consistency
```

Actions:
- `health` - Overview of knowledge base status (default)
- `orphans` - Find notes with no relations
- `duplicates` - Find overlapping notes
- `relations` - Suggest connections
- `tags` - Review tag consistency

### `/research <topic> [folder]`

Research a topic and save a structured report to Basic Memory.

```
/research MCP protocol
/research "database migrations"
/research "auth options" decisions
```

Produces a report with:
- Summary and key findings
- Analysis and recommendations
- Sources and related notes
- Saved to `research/` folder by default

## Skills

Model-invoked capabilities that Claude uses automatically based on context.

### knowledge-capture

Automatically captures insights, decisions, and learnings into structured notes.

**Triggers when:**
- Important decisions are made
- Technical insights are discovered
- Problems are solved
- Design trade-offs are discussed

### continue-conversation

Resumes previous work by building context from the knowledge graph.

**Triggers when:**
- Starting a new session
- User mentions previous work ("continue with...", "back to...")
- Need context about ongoing projects

### spec-driven-development

Guides implementation based on specifications stored in Basic Memory.

**Triggers when:**
- Implementing a feature defined by a spec
- Creating new specifications
- Reviewing implementation against criteria

### edit-note

Interactively edit notes using MCP tools in a conversational workflow.

**Triggers when:**
- User wants to edit, update, or modify a note
- User asks to change specific content in a note
- User wants to add observations or relations

**How it works:**
1. Fetches the note via MCP
2. Shows current content
3. Applies edits using `edit_note` operations (append, prepend, find_replace, replace_section)
4. Shows the updated result

**Best for:** Cloud users or when you want conversational editing.

### edit-note-local

Edit notes directly as local markdown files with automatic sync.

**Triggers when:**
- User has local Basic Memory installation
- User wants to make substantial file edits
- User prefers working with full file content

**How it works:**
1. Finds the note's file path via MCP
2. Uses Claude Code's Read/Edit/Write tools on the actual file
3. Basic Memory's `sync --watch` picks up changes automatically

**Best for:** Local users who want full file access and git integration.

### knowledge-organize

Help organize, link, and maintain the knowledge graph.

**Triggers when:**
- User wants to organize their notes
- User asks about orphan or unlinked notes
- User wants to find connections between notes
- User mentions duplicates or similar notes
- User asks for help with folder organization

**Capabilities:**
- **Find orphan notes** - Identify notes with no relations
- **Suggest relations** - Propose meaningful links between notes
- **Identify duplicates** - Find notes covering similar topics
- **Folder organization** - Review and suggest folder structure
- **Tag consistency** - Normalize and improve tagging
- **Create index notes** - Generate hub notes linking related topics
- **Enrich sparse notes** - Suggest observations and structure

**Best for:** Periodic knowledge base maintenance and improving discoverability.

### research

Research topics thoroughly and produce structured reports saved to Basic Memory.

**Triggers when:**
- User asks to research or investigate something
- User wants to understand a concept or technology
- User needs context before making a decision
- Phrases like "research", "look into", "explore", "investigate"

**What it produces:**
- Structured report with summary, findings, and analysis
- Recommendations when applicable
- Links to sources and related notes
- Saved to `research/` folder

**Best for:** Building knowledge base through investigation and documentation.
